# Student Dropout Prediction Project

## Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of a student dropping out using academic performance and attendance data. It helps educational institutions identify at-risk students and provide timely support to improve retention and academic success.

## Key Features
- **Admission Grades:** Initial academic performance upon entry.  
- **Semester Grades:** Performance trends across semesters.  
- **Attendance Percentage:** Class participation and engagement.  
- **Optional Features:** Extra-curricular involvement, disciplinary records, or assignment submission rates (if available).

## Machine Learning Models
- **Logistic Regression:** Baseline probability estimation.  
- **Random Forest Classifier:** Handles complex feature interactions and improves prediction accuracy.

## Workflow Steps
1. **Data Collection:** Gather historical student records labeled as “Dropout” or “Graduate.”  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical features, normalize numerical data, and scale features.  
3. **Feature Selection:** Analyze correlations and feature importance to identify the most influential factors.  
4. **Model Training:** Train selected models and optimize hyperparameters for accuracy.  
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and cross-validation.  
6. **Prediction & Intervention:** Identify at-risk students and enable targeted interventions like counseling, academic support, or attendance monitoring.
